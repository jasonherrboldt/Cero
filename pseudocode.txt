Identify where each of these actions occurs:

if player two discards a wild or a wd4
    player two must pick a color (Game.playerTwoMove -- under construction)
    player two must set its own chosen color (Game.playerTwoMove calls Player.setChosenColor)
    player two must tell the game object what its chosen color is (Game.playerTwoMove calls Game.setCurrentColor)
    the game object must tell player one what player two's chosen color is (Main.main calls Game.getCurrentColor)

if player one discards a wild or a wd4
    player one must pick a color (Main.main calls getUserResponse_chosenColor)
    player one must tell the game object what its chosen color is (Main.main calls Game.[???] which calls Game.setCurrentColor
    player two must be able to get that color to decide its next move (Game.playerTwoMove calls Game.getCurrentColor)
