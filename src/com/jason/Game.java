     *    Space out the console output for computer steps; make it look like the
     *    computer is thinking about what its doing, instead of just showing a dump
     *    of steps to the user. Might be fun to have it complain if it has to draw more
     *    than three cards.
     *
     *    Wouldn't it be cool if player 2 could keep track of what strategy it used for each deck,
     *    and whether or not it won that deck? It could then pick future strategies by whichever
     *    strategy produced the most wins.
     *
     *    "A defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand.
     *    However, an offensive strategy would suggest playing a 0 when the player wants to continue on the current
     *    color, because it is less likely to be matched by another 0 of a different color (there is only one 0 of
     *    each color, but two of each 1â€“9)." - uno wiki page
     *
     *    The computer might want to adopt a cautious strategy if it detects that player 1 is down to just a few
     *    cards.
